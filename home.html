					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>Founded in 1948 with the help of Mary Vasilakis and other youth whose families were members of the Pancretan Association of America, (PAA), the PYA is the oldest national Greek American youth association. Tens of thousands of youth and young adults have transitioned into adulthood through the PYA, passing along the sacred traditions and heritage of their ancestral homeland through their annual national and local events. The organization is currently comprised of twenty chapters throughout the United States and Canada and is governed by a national PYA Board of Directors. The group&#8217;s purpose is to promote and develop social and cultural relationships and mutuality among members of the Cretan Diaspora, promoting education through scholarships, raising philanthropic awareness through initiatives designed to aid institutions in the United States, Canada, on the island of Crete, and to help promote further community involvement in programs and discussions directed by the Pancretan Association of America (PAA).</p>

					<h1>Pan Cretan Youth of America</h1>
					<p>The purpose of the Pancretan Youth Association is and always shall be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To promote and develop social and cultural relationships and mutuality among all of the Cretans and their descendants residing in the United States and Canada.</li>

						<li>To give such moral encouragement and legal material assistance, which is considered necessary for the welfare and benefit of the members in the PYA.</li>
						<li>To work in co-operation with and as a part of the PAA, promoting its activities and programs of the PYA.</li>
						<li>To encourage those individuals who no longer qualify for membership to the PYA to enroll and continue to participate as members of the PAA.</li>
